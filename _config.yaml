description: Our research interest focus around the application of oxidoreductases for organic synthesis. These enzymes have a lot to offer for the organic chemist in terms of selectivity and efficiency. In particular, we are interested in biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization reactions using monooxygenases and peroxygenases as well as reduction reactions using alcohol dehydrogenases and ene reductases.
